<h1>Hi, I'm Aaliyah! </h1>
I’m a cybersecurity student pursuing my bachelor’s degree, with a passion for exploring all aspects of the field—from defending networks (blue team) to ethical hacking (red team) and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). I enjoy learning new skills, tackling challenges, and sharing knowledge through projects that showcase my growth. I appreciate you coming to my page and looking over my work!
